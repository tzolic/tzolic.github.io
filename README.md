# Responsive Portfolio Website

## a fully responsive portfolio website to showcase personal projects

## why use this?

- you want to develop a portfolio website for yourself that's simple and straight to the point
- you already have a portfolio and are looking for some design inspiration or code snippets (you want to steal some good looking code and that's completely fine feel free to do it)
- you want to see what projects I'm making (that's like 0.01% of people)
